# Addressables BuildLayout Explorer for Unity

BuildLayout Explorer for Unity allows you to inspect a buildlayout.txt file that was generated by Addressables.

BuildLayout Explorer allows to inspect:
* A list of Addressables Groups and what bundles have been generated by each group.
* A list of generated bundles and what assets each bundle contains.
* A list of all assets included in all bundles.
* A list of duplicated assets. The same asset that is copied in multiple bundles.

I've tested it with Unity 2019.3 and Addressables 1.18.x.
